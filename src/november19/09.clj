; Given a tree where each edge has a weight, compute the length of the longest path in the tree.
;
; For example, given the following tree:
;
;   a
;  /|\
; b c d
;    / \
;   e   f
;  / \
; g   h
;
; and the weights: a-b: 3, a-c: 5, a-d: 8, d-e: 2, d-f: 4, e-g: 1, e-h: 1,
; the longest path would be c -> a -> d -> f, with a length of 17.
;
; The path does not have to pass through the root, and each node can have any amount of children.

; like O(n!) because of this bad implementation.
